# SwordinAround
A multiplayer (local wifi/lan) game between 2 players who can freely move on a 2D map, dash and swing their swords. First to hit the enemy player wins the game. It utilizes the Serverr project in my repositories (the server must be turned on, in order for the game to work). Also, it has a logging in portal in the beggining. I have developed this game, along with a friend.
